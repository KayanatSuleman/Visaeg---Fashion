3. CSS STYLESHEET CONNECTION TO INDEX.HTML ISSUES:
   + Problem: Created a stylesheet called style.css linked stream-one.html. Under the "link ref =“stylesheet” href=“css/style/css" but it doesn’t update the website with the new added styles.
   + Solution: The reason why it didn’t work was because the css was written in capital letters, and the linked as not rightly linked/directed. Also I was connecting the stylesheet to stream-one.html and not by style.css. Also using Emmett don’t work, I have to type things out myself.

4. CSS STYLESHEET APPLICATION ON ALL HTML FILES:
    + Problem: Created assets folder, then put css - stylesheet.css in, as a folder and then put img in as a folder. Applied content to body i.e; purple font, both stream-two.html and stream-three.html work upon testing but stream-one.html doesn’t not.
    + Solution: Fixed link by copy pasting stream 3 data and force refresh from cache using shift and clicking the refresh button.

    Remember @ imports always go at the top of the page.

    Linked Logo.png using "a href=“assets/img/logo.png>" but no image display.

    + Problem: I want to make the logo.img centre.
    + Solution: Adapted from  stack overflow
    + Reference: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35162053/center-logo-in-html>

5. HOW TO ADD A HORIZONTAL LINE:
    + Problem:  How to add a horizontal line break.
    + Solution: Adapted from Hubspot. Overstack recommends: Drop hr and use border-top and border-bottom in conjunction with padding on the div.
    hr should be used as a horizontal rule.
    For instance, a hard separation of paragraph or a long break - and not as a visual element.
    However - decided to HR element - using css to style and width: 1200px max. After some experimentation I liked the visual look of width-max: 1250px.

    + Solution: Add hr element tag, top and bottom of nav element
	  + Add CSS styling and # hr { border: 1px solid black; width: 1150px; }
	  + Reduce the size of the line height : 15px; and height : 15px of the nav li.
    + Future improvements: I would like the nav bar contents responsive by getting larger when the cursor floats over the options to create a more interactive user experience. 

2. WEBSITE STRUCTURE - LOGO.png CONNECTED TO HOME - WHEN CLICKED:
   + Problem: Need to connect the image used for logo to index.html so log take you back to homepage when clicked by user.
