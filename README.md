### **Design**
>
> Color Scheme
>

+ The two main colours used are white, and black to mimic the style of an old school newspaper.
+ The background colour is #f9f7f1 - to resonate with the user idea of a newspaper and help draw the connection between an old school newspaper contrasted by modern images of fashion poses to create interest with the target audience.

>
> Typography
>

+ The Bebas Neue font is small and minimalistic to ensure that the interface remains elegant and subdued - small text also is resonant of a newspaper. To create a plethora of hierarchy I introduced three fonts in total, to complement the design of the website. The headings used the Playfair Display font, and the supporting text used the font EB Garamond to create contrast. The end result was a website that resonated the look and feel of a newspaper, but modern.

>
> Imagery
>

+ Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern aesthetic highlighting the models showcasing their outfits also helps the user understand the purpose of this website. The hero image also creates an interesting landing page which is inviting yet intreging for the user.

### **Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section**

>
> First Time Visitor Goals
>
+ i.  As a First Time Visitor, I want to see a clear and clean layout. Greeted with an aesthetic hero image, which depicts the intent of the website - a personal blog curated by a content creator.

  + a. As a user enters the website, they are greeted with an appealing and large logo, which allows them to connect the content creators brand with their personal social accounts.
  + b. The main points are made immediately with the nav bar.
  + c. The user has a concise and well-organised amount of options to click through on the nav bar, however as they scroll the home page they are greeted with two main clearly laid out sections, that help them further understand the use of the website and offer them value, as they search for their next fashion purchase.

+ ii.  As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

  + a. Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.
  + b. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
  + c. At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

>
> Returning Visitor Goals
>
+ i.  As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new articles centred around body positive messages and inspirational advice on how to dress to be confident.

  + a. These are clearly shown on the home page, under the WEEKLY EDIT header
  + b. They will be directed to a page with another hero image and a "click here" assertive comment.

+ ii.  A future integration that would be helpful for a user to contact the content creator would be to add a CONTACT ME section to the footer.

  + a. This would be added to the footer to add ease of collaboration of future brands or if a personal user is curious about advice.

+ iii.  As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Instagram and Tiktok links easily to my content creators social accounts.

  + a. The Instagram and TikTok social buttons can be found on the footer of the website - which are clickable. They direct the user directly to the associated page.
  + b. Alternatively, the user can find the associated Instagram pages linked on the SHOP MY OUTFITS tab from the navigation bar which is directly linked to the most relevant Instagram page. These links are directly linked to the affiliate links as defined by the Like to Know it widget.
  + c. If the user is on the HOME page of Visaeg then they can access the most recent but condensed favourite items as defined by the content creator - these items are updated automatically and regularly - per month.

>
> Frequent User Goals
>
+ i.  Frequent User, I wanted to ensure that every new post can be added easily onto the website on the Weekly Edit page
  + a. The user would have found this easy to navigate because each new article is published under a new month section.

+ ii.  As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new weekly edit articles.
  + a. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the weekly edit section - however it would also show on the main home page, where the new articles are published for ease.

+ iii.  As a Frequent User, I want to access the content creators favourite fashion items.
  + a. At the end of the home page- there is an accessible link which portrays the newest favourites of the month as dictated by the content creator. This is easily accessible as the like to know it widget allows the user to click on the item which takes the user directly to that particular item.
  + b. This is also followed by the next page on the website which can be accessible from the nav bar - the SHOP MY OUTFITS section of the website has a distinguished widget asset that allows the user to see all relevant and up to date posts from the content creators - linked directly to the content creators Instagram page. This is updated automatically so that the user is always up to date with the most cutting edge fashion recommendations which are easily shoppable via the direct link to the desired product.
  + c. A future integration that would be useful - would be to add product details to current articles directing the user to associated fashion items. This would increase the usability and usefulness of the article pages.

### **Further Testing**

+ The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
+ The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
+ A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
+ Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

3. CSS STYLESHEET CONNECTION TO INDEX.HTML ISSUES:
   + Problem: Created a stylesheet called style.css linked stream-one.html. Under the "link ref =“stylesheet” href=“css/style/css" but it doesn’t update the website with the new added styles.
   + Solution: The reason why it didn’t work was because the css was written in capital letters, and the linked as not rightly linked/directed. Also I was connecting the stylesheet to stream-one.html and not by style.css. Also using Emmett don’t work, I have to type things out myself.

4. CSS STYLESHEET APPLICATION ON ALL HTML FILES:
    + Problem: Created assets folder, then put css - stylesheet.css in, as a folder and then put img in as a folder. Applied content to body i.e; purple font, both stream-two.html and stream-three.html work upon testing but stream-one.html doesn’t not.
    + Solution: Fixed link by copy pasting stream 3 data and force refresh from cache using shift and clicking the refresh button.

    Remember @ imports always go at the top of the page.

    + Problem: I want to make the logo.img centre.
    + Solution: Adapted from  stack overflow
    + Reference: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35162053/center-logo-in-html>

5. HOW TO ADD A HORIZONTAL LINE:
    + Problem:  How to add a horizontal line break.
    + Solution: Adapted from Hubspot. Overstack recommends: Drop hr and use border-top and border-bottom in conjunction with padding on the div.
    hr should be used as a horizontal rule.
    For instance, a hard separation of paragraph or a long break - and not as a visual element.
    However - decided to HR element - using css to style and width: 1200px max. After some experimentation I liked the visual look of width-max: 1250px.

    + Solution: Add hr element tag, top and bottom of nav element
    + Add CSS styling and # hr { border: 1px solid black; width: 1150px; }
    + Reduce the size of the line height : 15px; and height : 15px of the nav li.
    + Future improvements: I would like the nav bar contents responsive by getting larger when the cursor floats over the options to create a more interactive user experience.

2. WEBSITE STRUCTURE - LOGO.png CONNECTED TO HOME - WHEN CLICKED:
   + Problem: Need to connect the image used for logo to index.html so log take you back to homepage when clicked by user.

1. ARTICLE IMPLEMENTATION AND STYLING ISSUES:
    + Problem: make and style a container for text and image per article.

    + Problem: too much white space between both articles on both index.
    html and stream-three.

    + Solution: Using previous knowledge was able to configure some css styling by testing the website after each change to see which style was right for the website.
    + Using previous knowledge on centring images I was able to replicate correct code to centre image in the middle of div by adding padding and assigning a style rule to the immediate html tag.
    + Solution to problem three <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19038799/why-is-there-an-unexplainable-gap-between-these-inline-block-div-elements>
